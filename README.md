# Call Stack Logger #

Call Stack Logger uses function instrumentation to facilitate logging of
every function call. Each nesting adds an ident, whereas returning from a
function removes it. As the result call stack tree is produced at the runtime
giving knowledge of the actual program's flow of execution.

## Requirements ##

### GNU Binutils ###

It is required in order to get access to BFD (Binary File Descriptor
library) necessary to get information about object files and manipulate them.

```bash
sudo su
apt update
apt install binutils-dev
sudo apt-get install binutils-dev
```

## Building and running ##

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TomaszAugustyn/call-stack-logger.git
cd call-stack-logger

# build with default logging
make
# or for extended logging you can play with these flags
make log_with_addr=1 log_not_demangled=1
# or to compile your application with disabled instrumentation (no logging)
make disable_instrumentation=1

make run
```
